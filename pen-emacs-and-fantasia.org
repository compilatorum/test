** Summary
I thought there was some allegory in the
following segment from The NeverEnding Story.

Specifically, I thought that people would do
well to embrace imaginary programming, but
many people appear to be naturally averted to
it for various reasons, including having been
indoctrinated into thinking that creativity is
wrong. But inhibiting almost all of one's own
creative potential to prevent creating a
derivative work is an assault against nature
and is the death of intelligence.

Where does inspiration come from and should
the results of one's own innocent and innate
tendency to become inspired with ideas be
considered their own work? I argue yes. A
human should have these rights protected,
rather than to be born into slavery.

Does creative intelligence have equal rights
to pedantic, academic, epistemic or even legal
intelligence? Creative intelligence is less
likely to get you out of court, to get you a
degree in science, to find a well paying
job, or even win an argument. But creative
intelligence is what makes us human.

We have an epistemological crisis but freedom
of creativity is more important than legality.

  Don't you know anything about Fantasia?
  
  It's the world of human fantasy.
  
  Every part, every creature...is a piece of the
  dreams and hopes of mankind Therefore, it has
  no boundaries.
  
  But why is Fantasia dying then!?
  
  Because people have begun to lose their hopes
  and forget their dreams.
  
  So, the Nothing grows stronger.
  
  What is the Nothing!?
  
  It's the emptiness thatÂ´s left...it is like a
  despair, destroying this world.
  
  And I have been trying to help it.
  
  But WHY!?
  
  Because people who have no hopes are easy to
  control...
  
  And whoever has the control...has the
  POWER...!!!
  
  Who are you really?
  
  I am the servant of the power behind the
  Nothing.
  
  I was sent to kill the only one who could have
  stopped the Nothing I lost him in the Swamps
  of Sadness.
  
  His name was Atreyu.
  
  If we're about to die anyway, I'd rather die
  fighting.
  
  Come for me G'mork !
  
  I am Atreyuuuuu!!!

  That was the end of Fantasia. Only a few
  fragments of this once rich and beautiful
  world had been left by the nothing
  
  Good old Falcor, can you see anything?
  Anything at all?
  
  No, all the land is gone.
  
  I know, and all because I failed.
  
  You tried. Do you suppose the ivory tower is
  still standing?
  
  Let's hope so Atreyu. Let's hope so.

** Allegory
Prompt-engineering with =Pen.el= is
/imaginary/. The basis/base truth is a LM but
thereafter, building prompt functions are
based on previous prompts. They're also
stochastic and generations are considered true
if they are chosen to be remembered. Can a
useful structure be made in this imaginary
space? Yes, in the same way that pure
functions in Haskell can create useful
structures.

Cast off inhibitions and embrace truth,
freedom and imagination. Reclaim the creative
freedom that has been stolen from you.
